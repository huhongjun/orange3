"Class :obj:`Instance` represents a data instance, typically retrieved "
"from a :obj:`Orange.data.Table` or :obj:`Orange.data.sql.SqlTable`. The "
"base class contains a copy of the data; modifying does not change the "
"data in the storage from which the instance was retrieved. Derived "
"classes (e.g. :obj:`Orange.data.table.RowInstance`) can represent views "
"into various data storages, therefore changing them actually changes the "
"data."
