msgid ""
"The class representing a value. The class is not used to store values but"
" only to return them in contexts in which we want the value to be "
"accompanied with the descriptor, for instance to print the symbolic value"
" of discrete variables."
msgstr ""

#: Orange.data.variable.Value:7 of
msgid ""
"The class is derived from `float`, with an additional attribute "
"`variable` which holds the descriptor of type "
":obj:`Orange.data.Variable`. If the value continuous or discrete, it is "
"stored as a float. Other types of values, like strings, are stored in the"
" attribute `value`."
msgstr ""

#: Orange.data.variable.Value:12 of
msgid ""
"The class overloads the methods for printing out the value: "
"`variable.repr_val` and `variable.str_val` are used to get a suitable "
"representation of the value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Equivalence operator is overloaded as follows:"

"unknown values are equal; if one value is unknown and the other is not, "
"they are different;"
msgstr ""

#: Orange.data.variable.Value:21 of
msgid ""
"if the value is compared with the string, the value is converted to a "
"string using `variable.str_val` and the two strings are compared"

#: Orange.data.variable.Value:24 of
msgid ""
"if the value is stored in attribute `value`, it is compared with the "

msgid "otherwise, the inherited comparison operator for `float` is called."
msgstr ""

#: Orange.data.variable.Value:29 of
msgid ""
"Finally, value defines a hash, so values can be put in sets and appear as"
" keys in dictionaries."

#: Orange.data.variable.Value:38 of

"Value; the value can be of arbitrary type and is used only for variables "
"that are neither discrete nor continuous. If `value` is `None`, the "
"derived `float` value is used."
